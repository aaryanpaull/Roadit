Roadit is a mobile-first web app that lets citizens report road issues like potholes or waterlogging with GPS-tagged photos and severity levels. Using Google Maps API and auto-escalation logic, it tracks reports, boosts transparency, and holds municipal bodies accountable via public dashboards.

**Roadit — Citizen-Powered Road Issue Reporter**

Roadit is a mobile-first web app that empowers citizens to report road irregularities (like potholes, waterlogging, or broken roads all identified by AI when picture upload by civillian) with GPS-tagged images and severity classification. It creates a transparent, accountable, and data-driven channel to bridge the gap between the public and municipal authorities.

**🔍 Problem**

Across many cities—especially in developing nations like India—damaged roads, potholes, waterlogging, and other infrastructure issues are a daily inconvenience and a serious safety hazard. These irregularities not only cause vehicle damage and traffic delays but also contribute to accidents, especially for two-wheeler riders and pedestrians.

While citizens frequently encounter these problems, the channels to report them are often outdated, fragmented, or bureaucratic. Complaints via phone calls, emails, or local portals typically lack transparency, offer no status updates, and rarely guarantee resolution. Citizens are left unaware of whether their complaint was received, reviewed, or acted upon.

Municipal authorities, on the other hand, lack a centralized, real-time system to monitor and prioritize public complaints based on severity or volume. Without data-driven insights, infrastructure planning remains reactive instead of preventive.

**🌟 Features**

📸 Photo Upload — Attach images of road issues directly from your phone or device

📍 Automatic Location Capture — Uses Google Maps API to grab exact coordinates

🗺️ Map Pin Adjustment — Drag to fine-tune the exact location of the issue

⚠️ Severity Classification — Tag issues as Minor, Moderate, or Severe, generated by AI

🧾 Issue Description — Optional details for better context, generated by AI

🔐 User Authentication — Track reports and avoid spam

🛠️ Municipal Dashboard — Officials can view, assign, and update reports

⏱️ Auto-Escalation — Severity-based timers for action; overdue issues are flagged

📊 Public Transparency Portal — Map view of all reports, status filters, and performance metrics

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

Frontend: Nextjs, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js

Database: Firebase

Cloud Storage: Firebase / Google Cloud Services

**📈 Impact**

Improves road safety via faster response

Enables public participation in civic infrastructure

Holds municipal authorities accountable through transparency and reduces corruption

Aids in long-term planning with real-time issue data

**🚀 Future Planning & Innovation**

To make Roadit a scalable, smart, and more impactful civic tool, several future enhancements are planned:

🧠 AI-Powered Severity Detection

Integrate machine learning models to analyze uploaded images and auto-classify severity (e.g., pothole depth, flooded area size).

Reduce manual input and improve consistency in reporting.

📡 IoT & Sensor Integration
Future versions could integrate with smart city infrastructure, using embedded road sensors or mobile device accelerometers to detect anomalies (e.g., sudden jolts indicating potholes) in real-time without manual reporting.

🔍 Advanced Analytics Dashboard
Build an analytics suite for municipal authorities to visualize hotspot areas, monitor average resolution time, and generate predictive maintenance alerts using heatmaps and trends.

🗣️ Multilingual Support & Voice Input
Add regional language support and voice-to-text reporting, increasing accessibility for non-English speakers and visually impaired users.

🤖 Chatbot Assistant
Integrate a chatbot to help users report issues, track their submissions, and get answers about municipal jurisdictions or process statuses.

🧾 Open API for Civic Data Access
Provide a public REST API for researchers, journalists, and urban planners to access anonymized report data, enabling community-driven tools and data-backed journalism.

🔐 Blockchain for Report Authenticity
Explore blockchain integration to create an immutable, tamper-proof log of reports and status changes, enhancing trust and transparency.

📱 Native Mobile App
Launch native Android and iOS apps for offline mode, background GPS tracking, and push notifications for updates and escalations.
